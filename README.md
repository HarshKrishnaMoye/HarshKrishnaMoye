👋 Hello there! I'm Harsh Moye, and I'm excited to have you here. Let me give you a glimpse into who I am and what I'm all about.

First off, I've always been a curious soul, fascinated by how things work. Whether it's dissecting gadgets or diving into the world of coding, I thrive on understanding the nuts and bolts of everything around me.

Coding has become my creative outlet. There's something magical about turning lines of code into digital realities, and I love every minute of it. But my interests don't stop there—I'm also passionate about design and the power it holds to transform experiences.

And beyond that, I'm also deeply passionate about acting, dancing, and playing sports like cricket, football, volleyball, and badminton. Whether it's rehearsing for a play or hitting the field, I love exploring different forms of expression and staying active.

💼 Certified Meta® Front-end Developer, ensuring top-notch performance and innovation in every project.

🔍 Passion runs deep in my veins for crafting experiences that not only catch your eye but also steal your heart. I dive deep into user behavior, ensuring every click feels like a smooth sail. Because technology isn't just about bits and bytes; it's about sparking real emotions and forging genuine connections.

🔬 Driven by curiosity and armed with a perfectionist's eye, I'm itching to dive into projects where innovation dances hand in hand with functionality. Let's turn your digital dreams into dazzling realities!
